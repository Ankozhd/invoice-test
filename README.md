## The problem

There is a strict government rule that requires businesses to never superpass value of 500$ per
invoice unless the product itself has a price larger than 500$, in that case one invoice should
contain only that product. Businesses must create multiple invoices, distributing products across
keeping in mind not to violate maximum value of invoice. Also, the government says that on one
invoice, the same product cannot be repeated more than 50 times. If a customer buys the same
product 100 times, that product should be separated into two different invoices for the same
order.
